# Primo Server

At this stage, we're relying heavily on external services (Vercel for hosting, Supabase for backend) to make deployment as easily as possible. But it would also be relatively easy to replace those services with your own infastructure, should you prefer that. 

If you're just building websites for yourself, you may prefer just using Primo Desktop. This project allows you to run Primo on a server so that you can access and edit your sites from any device and invite other developers and content editors to collaborate on them with you. 

## How it works

Primo Server deploys to Vercel and uses Supabase for authentication, database (PostgresSQL), and storage.
