# Self-hosted primo (WIP)

The goal of this project is to make it possible to run primo on your own server - including everything needed to run a typical CMS like authentication, the ability to invite collaborators, a database for code and content, probably even hosting. 

Setup and maintenance should be as simple as possible. Some OS projects have an incentive to make self-hosting harder than it has to be in order to sell subscriptions to the hosted version, but that doesn't apply here since the hosted version of primo is free and unlimited.

If you have any ideas or time to contribute, feel free to open an issue or come talk to us in the [primo Discord](https://discord.gg/vzSFTS9).
